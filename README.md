# api_tree

**api_tree** is a language-agnostic tool that leverages [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/) to parse source code and automatically extract structured API documentation. It is designed for extensibility, with first-class support for Rust and plans to support more programming languages in the future.

---

## Features

- üå≥ **Tree-sitter Powered**: Uses the powerful incremental parsing capabilities of tree-sitter to accurately analyze source code.
- ü¶Ä **Rust First**: Out-of-the-box support for Rust API extraction.
- üåê **Multi-language Ready**: Easily extendable to support other programming languages (e.g., Python, Go, Java).
- üìù **Structured Output**: Generates machine-readable, structured API documentation (e.g., JSON, YAML) suitable for AI use cases.
- ‚ö° **Easy Integration**: CLI and/or API interface for seamless integration into your workflow.

---

## Use Cases

- Generate up-to-date API documentation for your codebase.
- Feed API structures to AI models for code understanding, code search, or code generation.
- Enable multilingual codebase documentation in a unified format.
- Automate documentation processes in CI/CD pipelines.

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YageGeng/api_tree.git
   cd api_tree
   ```

2. **Build or Install**
   - (Instructions to build or install the tool, e.g., using Cargo, pip, npm, etc., depending on your implementation.)

3. **Extract API Documentation**
   ```sh
   api_tree extract --language rust --output api.json path/to/your/src
   ```

4. **(Optional) Extend for Other Languages**
   - See the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on adding new language support.
